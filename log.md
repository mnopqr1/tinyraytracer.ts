# A log of writing a raytracer on a train

* 09:53 - train departure from Nice. Actually still writing an unrelated e-mail.

* 10:33 - decided to go with the tiny ray tracer of ssloy. Porting putPixel and canvas from the Gambetta book.

* 11:21 - finished step 1 in javascript, a nice gradient appears.

* 11:53 - decided to move to typescript - bit of hacking to get compiler to work in emacs. Procrastinating on the intersection method because there is some thinking involved.

* 12:22 - took a quick lunch break.

* 13:48 - ALMOST got step 2 to work, after a lot of struggles with vectors and viewports, but there's still a problem: the sphere shows up as ellipses.
